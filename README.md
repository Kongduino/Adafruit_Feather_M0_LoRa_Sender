# Adafruit_Feather_M0_LoRa_Sender

A quick sample project demonstrating sending/receiving LoRa packets on an Adafruit Feather M0 with Sandeep Mistry's LoRa library.

Most sample projects I have seen seemed to be using awkward (to me anyway) libraries like RadioHead or LMIC, whereas there are easier solutions. I use this code paired with an M5Stack with a LoRa module and some custom code that decodes JSON packets and sends back plain text.
